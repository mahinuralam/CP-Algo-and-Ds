RIGHT SHIFT :

5 << 1

Here << is the symbol of right shift
1 is the number of right shifts
It will result 5 * 2^i [ i = 1]

Again, 5 << 4 = 60 

Because, 2^4 = 16*5 = 60


LEFT SHIFT :

8 >> 2

Here >> is the symbol of left shift
2 is the number of right shifts
It will result 8 /  2^i [ i = 2]

Again, 100 << 5 = 32

Because, 2^5 =  100 / 32 = 3
